1. compare total input strength between fc vs f0; Q: does the difference in fc and f0 result from differences in Imeans? probably need to match the # of spikes in the input spike trains.

2. calculate cooperation, competition, and coactivity indices
	coactivity: sum(min(rE1(t),rE2(t)),t) with r's calculated in nonoverlapping 10ms bins
	normalized coactivity: coactivity/Nbins/max(rE1(:),rE2(:))
	cooperation: dot(nE1(t),nE2(t)) where nEX(t)=# spikes in pop X in time bin t
	normalized cooperation: cooperation/(sum(nE1)*sum(nE2))
	competition: sum(nE1)-sum(nE2)
	normalized competition: ...

TODO:
1. match <s1> and <s2>, so only difference is spectral content
2. calculate f0=f(gINPUT) and fc=f(gINPUT) given matched input strengths and/or # spikes
- look at spectral content of E1 and E2, as well as competition/synchrony/coactivity indices
	Q: how does it depend on which input is faster? closer to natural frequency? closer to resonance frequency?
- consider INfast only, INslow only, and both (look for two spectral peaks in E1 and E2); represents ACC L2/3 vs L5/6
	Q: does each pop follow the frequency of its input? inherit frequency of the other? 
	Q: how does that depend on whether there is one inhibition time constant, two, and its specific value?
- consider model with H-channel and M-channel

competition = |NE1-NE2|/max(NE1,NE2) where NEx = (# spikes in pop x)

- simulations are 2-3 seconds
- single cell spike rates (# spikes in one cell / time bin) may be as low as 5Hz (therefore need 200ms bin size for rate calculation)
- want to assess how synchronous spikes are between two populations of N cells each
- spiking is "synchronous" between populations A and B if each has spikes occurring within 10ms of each other 

story:
1a. how spectral content of rhythmic inputs determines combinatorial processing in target populations? how and in what regime input spectra can be used to route activity?
1b. how input spectra-based routing depends on inhibition time constants (INfast,INslow,both) and ephys heterogeneity (iH,iM,Eleak)|(none,low,high) at different drives
2a. how inputs (and maybe E/INfast/INslow connectivity) shape formation of rule-coding (contextual) rhythmic E assemblies
2b. how differential spike synchrony can be used to route activity? (i.e., how rhythmic input competes with nonrhythmic input). 
2c. how that depends on target reader cell and network properties.


--------------------------------------
Q for Salva: should I balance mean input or # spikes?
	goal: want spectral content to be only difference driving E1 vs E2
	need to figure out why fc and f0 differ so much for same gINPUT
Q for Nancy: is spike synchrony/coherence a better way to frame "cooperative" activity? and to discuss competition and synchrony as independent axes.
